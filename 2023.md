## Goals for this year

* ฝึกฝนการเขียน Automate test script สัก 1 tool.

## Goals for next year

* ศึกษา Automate test tool ->  [WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io). เพื่อใช้ในการเทส Mobile Application

## Projects

For each one, go through:

* What your contributions were (did you come up with the design? Which components did you build? Was there some useful insight like "wait, we can cut scope and do what we want by doing way less work" that you came up with?)
* The impact of the project - who was it for? Are there numbers you can attach to it? (saved X dollars? shipped new feature that has helped sell Y big deals? Improved performance by X%? Used by X internal users every day?). Did it support some important non-numeric company goal (required to pass an audit? helped retain an important user?)

Remember: don't forget to explain what the results of you work actually were! It's often important to go back a few months later and fill in what actually happened after you launched the project.

## What you learned

* learned course online : [Software Quality Assurance and Testing : Introduction to testing Principles and Structured Testing Techniques ( Mahidol University Extension ; MUx )](https://mux.mahidol.ac.th/edxphp/getcer/982a9e2ff4c07dfe1b610340df9b2c9a442a846d)
* internals of an important piece of software (like the JVM or Postgres or Linux)
* how to use a library (like React)
* how to use an important tool (like the command line or Firefox dev tools)
* about a specific area of programming (like localization or timezones)
* an area like product management / UX design
* how to write a clear design doc
* a new programming language

It's really easy to lose track of what skills you're learning, and usually when I reflect on this I realize I learned a lot more than I thought and also notice things that I'm not learning that I wish I was.

## Outside of work
